    <h4>Song by Hiroshi Kitadani,

    <h4>It was used as the first opening theme for the One Piece television anime, accompanying most of the episodes
        comprising the East Blue Saga. As a result, it became a sort of shorthand for the Straw Hat Pirates'
        earliest
        adventures (and, among the wider public, for the series as a whole).

        [Intro]
        Gathering up all the pieces of our dreams
        We're going to search for everything we're looking for
        One Piece!

        [Verse 1]
        The compass will only slow us down
        Filled with excitement, I take the helm
        If we can prove the dusty old treasure map
        Then it won't be a legend anymore

        [Pre-Chorus]
        It’s alright if our internal storms
        Get on someone else’s nerves
        Because we think about them too much

        [Chorus]
        Gathering up all the pieces of our dreams
        We're going to search for everything we're looking for
        A coin in the pocket
        You wanna be my friend?
        We are, we are on the cruise
        We are
    
        [Verse 2]
        Even though I believe everything they tell me
        If you push me on the shoulder, I’ll be one step ahead
        If we ever meet again, I’ll tell you all about
        What I’ve been doing and where I’m headed next

        [Pre-Chorus]
        In other words, being in a pinch is always
        A good opportunity to ask for backup
        And overcome one's excessive shyness

        [Chorus]
        Full steam ahead through the stingy night
        I’m not interested in treasure anyway
        A romance in my pocket
        You wanna be my friend?
        We are, we are on the cruise
        We are

        Gathering up all the pieces of our dreams
        We're going to search for everything we're looking for
        A coin in the pocket
        You wanna be my friend?
        We are, we are on the cruise
        We are

        [Outro]
        We are
        We are
